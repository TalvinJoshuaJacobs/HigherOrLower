# 'Higher or Lower'

### I. Initiative

Higher or Lower is guessing game coded in C++. It is set inside the command line, and the player is presented with a random number between 1 and 10. This number, as well as a second hidden random number with the same properties is generated by the computer. The player has to guess whether the hidden random number is higher or lower than the number presented to them. If they guess correctly, they win, and if not, they lose.
The user is then prompted with a question asking them if they would like to play again.

### II. Epics and User Stories

##### Epics

 - [The game is coded in C++ using any IDE and Compiler]
 - The user needs to input a choice, either "h" for choosing higher, or "l" for lower
 - The computer generates 2 random numbers. One is presented to the user, and the other is hidden
 - If the user is correct in their choice, they win, and if they are wrong, they lose
 - If the two randomly generated numbers are equal to each other, regardless of the user input, the game ends in a draw
 - The user is prompted with a question asking them if they would like to play again.
 - The user needs to decide and enter "y" to play again, or "n" to stop playing

##### Non-Functional Requirements

 - If the user enters an invalid input, they are prompted with the same question and asked to answer it again
 - If the computer re-asks the user a question, it is presented on a separate line away from the previous question, to reduce screen clutter

##### User Stories

 - "As a player, I would like the computer to generate two separate random integers between 1 and 10 inclusive"
 - "As a player, I would like to see the first number presented to me, and the second one hidden from me"
 - "As a player, I would like to input my decision as to whether I think the second number is higher or lower than the first (presented one)"
 - "As a player, I would like to see the computer give me feedback based on my input"
 - "As a player, I would like to be asked if I want to play again or not"
 - "As a player, I would like the computer to take my input and use it to decide whether or not the game will be replayed or not"
 - "As a player, I would like the hidden number to be displayed once the computer gives me feedback on whether I have won or not"
 - "As a player, I would like to have a motive, such as a score which is displayed, correlating to the number of guesses I have made correctly"
 - "As a player, I would like to be greeted with the name of the game at the beginning"

##### How We Addressed The Requirements

A plan was devised so that all the functional requirements would be completed with the highest priority, followed by the non-functional requirements.

### III. Genre

A command-line guessing game.

### IV. Technical Details

##### Platform

The program was coded on an online IDE - https://repl.it/. It compiles and executes a single piece of code in seconds, which was perfectly suitable for the project.

##### Programming Language/Environment

C++ was the language used

##### How the use of an IDE managed the development process of "Higher or Lower"

repl.it turned out to be extremely advantageous when used over a default non-IDE text editor like Notepad.

The syntax highlighting was useful for ensuring the code being written was consistent. No spelling errors or mistypes were discovered after the code was complete, but only a few seconds after making them. This greatly sped up the process of writing the code, hence more time was spent on sections that held a greater portion of significance.

Having an online IDE like repl.it meant that testing out the code was more efficient than if a standard non-IDE text editor was used. If the latter was used, a separate compiler had to be used which takes time, leaving less time other, possibly more important parts. For example, time was more efficiently spent coding the function responsible for providing the user with feedback on their chosen input because the IDE was used to code it.

The process of debugging was made shorter by using the automatic compiler and command line output provided by repl.it. Many errors popped up as a result of adding new functions to the game, for example, adding a restart game function. After learning about the `goto` function, experimentation was conducted on its usage in the code, and a solution was swiftly arrived at.

repl.it was purely used for everything apart from saving the code, which was instead saved locally on a notepad document, for copying and pasting.

##### Programming Challenges

There were a couple of obstacles in the way of completing the program:

 - Working out a way for the computer to generate two random numbers that are not always the same
 - Getting the computer to re-ask two different questions when need be, using while loops and the goto function.

##### Constructing And Implementing My Code

Firstly, after understanding the functional requirements of the game, a flowchart was created to help devise a plan on how to start with the logic already sorted. Then, the random number generation was programmed first, followed by the functions that get the user input (and give them feedback on what they chose and whether or not they were right or not). Then the "play again" function and the "please enter your input again" functions were implemented using 'goto' functions and while loops.

##### Algorithms

There are two main algorithms that are present in this program.

The first one is responsible for generating two random integers between 1 and 10 separately. This is done by generating the first random number with time (to make the number as 'random' as possible).

    srand(time(NULL));
    int randomNumber1(rand() % 10 + 1);
^ This ends up generating a random integer within the range 10, shifted 1 up (to change the conditions from 0-9 inclusive to 1-10 inclusive)

The second number is generated by using a third random number in the space of "NULL" which automates the generation and causes the second number to normally be different to the first:

    srand(time_t(rand() % 7 + 7));
    int randomNumber2(rand() % 10 + 1);
The second algorithm present is responsible for taking the users inputs and outputting information based on these inputs. The first user input is a decision made regarding the hidden number being higher or lower than the first. The second is a decision on whether the user would wish to play the game again or not.

If the user chooses higher, and the hidden number *is* higher than the first number, the user wins. If the user chooses higher and the hidden number is *not* higher than the first number, the user loses, and vice versa.
If both randomly generated numbers happen to be the same, regardless of the user input, the game ends in a draw.

If the user types "y" for yes when prompted to play again, the game will restart and 2 new random integers will be generated. If the user types "n" when prompted, the game will end. Otherwise, the user is asked to input their choice again.

##### Coding Standards

 - *For variables:* The comments begin a single tab-space after the last letter of the line that defines the variable. They comments themselves are brief, simple sentences which outline what the variable is eg. `Gamer.x = 1000; // The x co-ordinate of the player's starting position` 
 - *For the introduction:* The introduction is written in full English sentences that make grammatical sense. Sentence example: `// TraceBall (EscapeTheEnemyBox) is a 2D browser game coded in Javascript.`
 - *For functions:* As with variables, the comments begin a single tab-space after the last letter of the line that defines the function. These comments are also brief and the sentences are not in full. Example: `// A "Restart Game" function.`
 - *For "chunks of code":* A comment is made one line before the chunk of code, and one line gap further from the previous chunk (which may end with a closed curly parenthesis or a semicolon). The sentence explaining the chunk of code will be of more detail than a short sentence that describes a function or variable, but of slightly less detail than the introduction. Example: `// Defining the mathematical variables`

### V. Research

No other research apart from searching for syntax of the random number generation was used. Only this website forum discussion was referred to: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26232307/how-can-i-generate-a-random-number-each-time-a-variable-is-called

##### Flowchart

##### Functions

 - "Computer picks a random integer between 1 and 10 inclusive": Using    `srand(time(NULL));`
followed by `int randomNumber1(rand() % 10 + 1);`
^ This ends up generating a random integer within the range 10, shifted 1 up (to change the conditions from 0-9 inclusive to 1-10 inclusive)

 - "Computer picks another random integer between 1 and 10 inclusive": The second number is generated by using a third random number in the space of "NULL" which automates the generation and causes the second number to normally be different to the first:
    `srand(time_t(rand() % 7 + 7));`
   `int randomNumber2(rand() % 10 + 1);`
   
 - "Get users input" will make use of `cin` and use functions to be able to store them for later use when the input is passed through several `if` statements.

##### Flowchart -> Code (Yet to be shown below)

The outcome of the game:

    // If the two computer generated random numbers are the same...
    if (randomNumber1 == randomNumber2) {
    cout << "Draw!" << endl << endl; // The game ends in a draw
    }

    // If the displayed random number is higher than the hidden random number and the player choses "l" for lower...
    if ((randomNumber1 > randomNumber2) && (userChoice == "l")) {
    cout << "You win!" << endl << endl; // The player wins
    }

    // If the displayed random number is higher than the hidden random number and the player choses "h" for higher...
    else if ((randomNumber1 > randomNumber2) && (userChoice == "h")) {
    cout << "You lose!" << endl << endl; // The player loses
    }

    // If the displayed random number is smaller than the hidden random number and the player choses "h" for higher...
    else if ((randomNumber1 < randomNumber2) && (userChoice == "h")) {
    cout << "You win!" << endl << endl; // The player wins
    }

    // If the displayed random number is smaller than the hidden random number and the player choses "l" for lower...
    else if ((randomNumber1 < randomNumber2) && (userChoice == "l")) {
    cout << "You lose!" << endl << endl; // The player loses
    }

Rematch:

> "Would you like to play again?"

    cout << "Would you like to play again? Type 'y' for yes, or 'n' for no: ";

    // Receiving the player's input on whether they want to play again or not and taking action based on this input
    string playAgain; // They player's decision to play again or not is a string
    cin >> playAgain; // The player's input is taken in
    clock; paDecider(playAgain); // The program goes to the conditional function paDecider with this recieved information and carries it out

    // When the player types "y" for yes...
    while (playAgain == "y") {
	    goto rematch; // The program will be sent to "rematch:" so the player can play again
	    break; // Stops the while loop from flooding the command line and crashing it
    }

    // When the player does not type in "y" for yes or "n" or no...
    while (playAgain != "y" && playAgain != "n") {
	    cout << "Please type that in again..." << endl << endl; // The player is prompted to type in the choice again correctly
	    goto retryAgain; // The program is sent to "retryAgain:" for the player to retype their decision
	    break; // Stops the loop from again, flooding the command line and crashing it
    }

 ### VII. Evaluation

Overall, I felt very comfortable with this project. Since C++ is a language I am most familiar with in comparison to other programming languages, the syntax was not an issue. Neither was the logic once I completed the flowchart before diving into the programming itself.
I managed to complete all of the functional requirements. A few of the non-functional requirements were completed, but some can still be added on without any trouble, since no serious code manipulation is involved with that.
